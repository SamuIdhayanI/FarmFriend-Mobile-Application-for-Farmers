# FarmFriend: A Mobile Application for Farmers in India
FarmFriend is an Android application designed to help farmers find the best price range for their products by displaying offers from various dealers. The app also allows dealers to find and purchase products from nearby farmers, facilitating a more transparent and efficient market.

After harvesting their crops, farmers need to find the best price range for their products. Dealers who collect these harvests often set a price range that is convenient for them, which may not reflect the actual market value. Different dealers offer different price ranges, making it challenging for farmers to find the best deal. FarmFriend aims to address this issue by providing a smart solution that benefits both farmers and dealers.
